Basic concept of in object oriented programming
/* classes- basic templete for creating objects.
* object- basic run time entities
* Data Abstraction & Encapulation - wrapping data and function into single unit.
* Inheritence- properties of one class can be inherited into others.
* Polymorphism- ability to take more than one forms.
* Dynamic bilding- code which will excute is not known until the program run.
* massage passing- object massage(information) call format. */


Benefits of object oriented programming
/* better code reusability using objects and inheritance.
* principle of data hiding helps build secure sysstems.
* multiple objects can co-exist without any interference.
* software complexity can be easily managed.
